# 💖 "Will You Be My Valentine?" — Interactive Love Page

## Overview
A romantic, playful single-page website with smooth animations, a soft pink/red theme, and interactive elements to pop the Valentine's question in the most memorable way.

---

## 1. Visual Theme & Design
- **Color palette**: Soft pinks, warm reds, blush tones, and white with gold accents
- **Typography**: Elegant cursive/handwritten font (e.g., Google Fonts "Dancing Script" or "Great Vibes") paired with a clean body font
- **Background**: Subtle floating hearts animation, soft gradient from blush pink to warm rose
- **Glowing effects**: Soft glows behind text and buttons for a dreamy feel

---

## 2. Hero Section — "Will You Be My Valentine?"
- Large, centered romantic heading: **"Will you be my Valentine? 💖"**
- Below it, a soft subtitle: *"Every moment with you feels like magic, and I want this Valentine's Day to be ours."*
- Gentle fade-in entrance animation
- Floating heart particles in the background

---

## 3. Interactive Buttons — Yes & No

### ✅ YES Button
- Big, glowing pink/red button with a heartbeat pulse animation on hover
- On click: triggers a celebration screen with confetti + floating hearts explosion
- Displays message: **"Yayyy! You just made me the happiest person alive ❤️"**
- Smoothly transitions/scrolls down to reveal the Photo Gallery and Love Letter sections

### ❌ NO Button
- Starts visible next to the Yes button
- **Runs away** from the cursor — moves to a random position on hover (desktop) or on tap (mobile)
- Shows playful text after a few attempts: *"Heyyy, that button is broken 😜"*
- Effectively impossible to click — fun and lighthearted

---

## 4. Photo Gallery Section
- Grid of **6 placeholder photo slots** styled as Polaroid-style frames (white border, slight rotation, soft shadow)
- Each card fades in with a slide-up animation as it appears
- Caption beneath the gallery: *"Us, my favorite story 💕"*
- You can later replace placeholder images with your real couple photos

---

## 5. Love Letter Section
- Elegant card/text box styled like a handwritten letter on parchment
- Contains the romantic message:
  > *"From random laughs to quiet moments, from silly fights to deep talks — every version of life feels better with you in it. You're not just my Valentine, you're my safe place, my happiness, my home."*
- Soft fade-in animation on scroll
- Decorative heart flourishes around the card

---

## 6. Background Music (Optional)
- A small floating mute/unmute button in the corner
- Plays a soft romantic tune on unmute (using a royalty-free audio file placeholder)
- Muted by default to respect browser autoplay policies

---

## 7. Responsive Design
- Fully responsive layout for mobile and desktop
- Buttons, gallery grid, and text all adapt gracefully to smaller screens
- The "No" button escape behavior works on both touch and mouse interactions
